## What does CommsKit do?

CommsKit is a powerful multi-protocol testing & monitoring platform with an intuitive back to basics interface crafted for all skill levels. Put simply; testing as it should be.

Monitor and test your MIDI, OSC, HTTP, UDP, TCP commands using your computer before getting to site with CommsKit's Inbound Routes, or use CommsKit to efficiently troubleshoot existing control systems.

Use CommsKit's Outbound Routes to send requests to other devices using MIDI, OSC, HTTP, UDP and TCP. All your requests are saved so you can quickly access and test your systems.

Run CommsKit in Dark or Light mode so you can keep working in any environment.
